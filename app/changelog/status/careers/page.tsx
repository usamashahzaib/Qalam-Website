                  We're at the stage where every person has a huge impact. There's no bureaucracy, 
                  no six-week approval cycles, no "let's circle back on this." You'll ship things 
                  that real users use within your first week.

                <p>
                  We're honest about what we don't know. We share numbers with everyone — 
                  revenue, churn, what's working, what's broken. No information silos.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We work hard, but we're not martyrs about it. Great work comes from clear heads, 
                  not 80-hour weeks. We optimize for sustained output over heroic sprints.

                <p className="text-white font-medium">
                  We're building a $100M company. That's not a fantasy — it's a plan. 
                  And the people who join now will have the equity and the story to show for it.
