              Qalam started because every AI writing tool we tried made us sound like everyone else. 
              Generic. Corporate. Forgettable. We knew the technology could do better — 
              so we built the tool we actually wanted to use.

                <p>
                  Our co-founder Aisha had spent 45 minutes trying to write a LinkedIn post about 
                  a lesson she'd learned the hard way. She knew exactly what she wanted to say. 
                  She just couldn't get it out right.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She tried three different AI tools. Each one gave her something polished, 
                  professional, and completely lifeless. The kind of post that gets 12 likes from 
                  people who weren't really reading it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So she called Raza. And they spent the next six months building something different — 
                  a tool that asks "what do you actually sound like?" before it writes a single word.
                </p>
                <p className="text-white font-medium">
                  That's Qalam. Named after the Arabic and Urdu word for "pen" — because the best 
                  writing tool should feel like an extension of your hand, not a replacement for your brain.
